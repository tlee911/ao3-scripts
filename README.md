# ao3-scripts

Work in progress.  No guarantee that anything in here actually works.
Some scripts for grabbing publicly available data (work tags, word counts, etc.) from a given fandom for analysis.

## Requirements
Python 3 (I recommend using https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv or Docker)

## Getting Started
* Get the code (clone the repo)
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Edit fandom.py to set configuration values (which fandom, output filename, etc.)
* `python3 fandom.py`
